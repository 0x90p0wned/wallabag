Errors during fetching articles
===============================

Why does the fetch of an article fail?
--------------------------------------

There may be several reasons:

- network problem
- wallabag can't fetch content due to the website structure

How can I help to fix that?
---------------------------

- `by sending us an email with the article's URL <mailto:hello\@wallabag.org>`_
- by trying to fix this article by yourself :) by creating a file for the article.
  You can use `this tool <http://siteconfig.fivefilters.org/>`__.

How can I try to re-fetch this article?
---------------------------------------

If wallabag failed when fetching an article, you can click on the reload button
(the third on the below picture).
