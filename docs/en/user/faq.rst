Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

During the installation, I've got this error ``Error Output: sh: 1: @post-cmd: not found``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It seems you have a problem with your ``composer`` installation. Try to uninstall and reinstall it.

`Read the documentation about composer to know how to install it
<https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md>`__.

I can't valid the registration form
-----------------------------------

Make sure that all fields are well filled:

* valid email address
* same passwords in two fields

I don't receive my activation email
-----------------------------------

Are you sure your email address was correct? Did you check your spams folder?

When I click on the activation link, I've got this message: ``The user with confirmation token "DtrOPfbQeVkWf6N" does not exist``.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You already enabled your account or the URL of the activation email is wrong.

I forgot my password
--------------------

You can reset your password by clicking on ``Forgot your password?`` link,
on the login page. Then, fill the form with your email address or your username,
you'll receive an email to reset your password.
