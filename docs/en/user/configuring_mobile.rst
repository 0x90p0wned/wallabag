Configuring Mobile Apps to Work With wallabag.it
================================================

Steps to configure the app
---------------------------

- First *create a new client* in the ``Developer`` section. The name of your app doesn't matter as much as the ``Client ID`` and the ``Client secret``. Write these two values down.
- When you download a mobile app, it's going to ask for the server address of the hosted wallabag instance. With wallabag.it that is: ``https://app.wallabag.it``.
- It's also going to ask for the aforementioned ``Client ID`` and ``secret``. Please insert those in the text fields, when asked.
- Lastly you need to provide your ``username`` and ``password``. These are the same credentials you use to login in to wallabag.it.

Please also have a look at `Android <android>`_. Especially the section on *known limitations*.
